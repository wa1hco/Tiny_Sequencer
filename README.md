This sequencer software is an arduino sketch for use with the ATTiny[816 1616] microcontroller.
The software is copyright 2024 by jeff millar, wa1hco.  The software is licensed under the GPL V3

The software supports one Key input and 4 contact closure outputs.
The input is configurable for either High or Low for key asserted.
Each output is contact closure configurable for normally CLOSED or OPEN state when not keyed. But when powered off, the contacts are OPEN.

Other features of the software
* option USB serial communication with a computer
* USB interface for programming or comms based on jumper
* ability to key using RTS
* ability to read state of key using CTS
* user configurable assert and release times for each step
* user configurable transmit timeout

Design as described in the sketch comments
// on Key asserted, transition thru states to Tx, assuming key remain asserted
//   state S1T, assert relay 1, wait relay 1 assert time; usually antenna transfer relay
//   state S2T, assert relay 2, wait relay 2 assert time; usually transverter relays
//   state S3T, assert relay 3, wait relay 3 assert time; usually (something)
//   state S4T, assert relay 4, wait relay 4 assert time; transmitter
//   state Tx, transmit ready, assert CTS
//   
// on key released, transition thru states to Rx, assuming key remains released
//   State S4R, release relay 4, release CTS, wait relay 4 release time
//   State S3R, release relay 3, wait relay 3 release time
//   State S2R, release relay 2, wait relay 2 release time
//   State S1R, release relay 1, wait relay 1 release time 
//   receive ready

// on key released during transition to transmit
//   release relay immediately
//   wait relay release time
//   transition to next release step

// on key asserted during transition to receive
//   assert relay immediately
//   wait relay asert time
//   enter transition to next transmit step

// state machine has 
//   Rx state holds as long as key released
//   Tx state holds as long as key asserted
//   4 Tx timed states for relays asserted
//   4 Rx timed states for relays released
//   Tx states exit to corresponding Rx state if key released
//   Rx states ex it to corresponding Tx State if key asserted
//   Timed states set timers on transition into that state
//   Timer values set based on relay close and open times, may be different
//   Timeout causes transition to next state in Rx to Tx or Rx to Tx sequence

// Keying
//   Key inputs are external wire or RTS from USB serial port
//   Key inputs configurable as asserted HIGH or LOW
//   Key inputs are converted High true logic and OR'd together
//   Key is AND'd with TxTimout
//   RX state will reset TxTimeout if key signal and RTS both released

// State Machine ASCII art, legend () for state name, [] for event name 
//
